GCD Calculator in C

This program computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using both iterative and recursive approaches.

Files

gcd.c: Contains the main program and the implementations of the iterative and recursive GCD algorithms.

How to Compile and Run

Compile the program:
gcc -o gcd_calculator gcd.c
Run the executable:
./gcd_calculator

Features

Interactive Input: Prompts the user to enter two positive integers.

Two Approaches:
Iterative GCD: Uses a loop to calculate the GCD.
Recursive GCD: Uses recursion to achieve the same result.
Error Handling: Validates user input to ensure only positive integers are accepted.

Sample Input and Output

Example 1:
Enter two positive integers: 56 98
GCD of 56 and 98 is 14
GCD of 56 and 98 is 14

Example 2:
Enter two positive integers: -5 20
Invalid input (as it does not take -ve integer.)

This program is a simple yet effective demonstration of calculating the GCD using multiple approaches in C.
