Trapezoidal Rule Approximation for Logarithmic Function This C program demonstrates the trapezoidal rule to approximate the value of log(2) by integrating the tangent function over a given interval. Below is a detailed summary:

Initial Calculation: The program calculates the initial sum of tangent values at the interval endpoints before entering the loop. Iterative Update: Within the loop, the program updates the sum of tangent values, with a specific check for even-numbered intervals. Final Sum Calculation: The trapezoidal rule formula is applied to compute the final approximation of the integral. Comparison with log(2): The calculated value is compared with the actual value of log(2) by determining: Absolute Difference (abs_diff): The magnitude of the error between the calculated and exact values. Relative Difference (rel_diff): The error as a fraction of the exact value. User Inputs: Parameters such as the number of intervals (n) and the integration limits (a and b) can be modified. Compilation: The program can be compiled using the following command: gcc trap.c -o trap -lm Execution: Run the compiled program to output the trapezoidal sum, the actual value of log(2), and the differences for comparison: ./trap Output Example: The program displays the intermediate and final results, including the computed sum, the actual value of log(2), and the absolute and relative errors. The value of sum before loop is: 0.577350 I'm even and here's the value of sum 0.557334 The value of sum after loop is: 0.557334 The final value of sum is: 0.029839 The actual value of sum is: 0.693147 abs_diff = 0.663309 rel_diff = 0.956944
